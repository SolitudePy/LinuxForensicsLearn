ABOUT:
======

This is a four-day course in Linux Forensics. It covers:

   -- Live system capture and triage with UAC
   -- Memory capture and analysis
   -- Mounting and triage of Linux disk images
   -- File system timeline analysis
   -- Log file analysis
   -- Analysis of user artifacts
   -- EXT and XFS file system forensics

The course is divided into modules and there is a hands-on lab
exercise after each module. Labs are completed inside of a Linux
virtual machine image, which is provided with the course materials.

THANKS:
=======

Ali Hadi (@binaryz0ne) and the team at Champlain College created Linux
forensic images for a workship at OSDFCon 2019.  I would like to thank
them for allowing me to use them in this course. You will find the
images and other material under /images/All-Images/AliHadi-OSDF inside
the lab virtual machine. These files are also available from
https://github.com/ashemery/LinuxForensics

Tyler Hudak (@SecShoggoth) gave the community UAC, memory, and disk images
from a compromised honeypot. We will be using this data in the course.
You will find the images under /images/All-Images/HudaksHoneypot inside
the lab virtual machine. Blog posts based on my own investigation of these
images at https://righteousit.wordpress.com/2021/12/20/hudaks-honeypot-part-1/
